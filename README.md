How to run application:
1. start up a virtual environment
2. run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. run "export FLASK_APP=catering.py"
4. run "flask initdb"
    -- I have created some events and staff and they are all created with this function. If you look at the initdb function, you will see what I created. However, I did not make any customers, so you can create a new customer to go through and test things. 
5. run "python catering.py"
6. Navigate to localhost:5000
